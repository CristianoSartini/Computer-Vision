## Introduction
The goal of the project was to implement a **look and move vision control architecture** on the Arduino arm, namely a position controlled robot in which a vision device (camera) is used to detect an object in the 
robotâ€™s scene, whose position (and orientation) is then used for online path planning in order to drive the robot to the identified object, which in our case was a 3D printed cube (the orange one in the image above). This GitHub repository aims to showcase the educational and exploratory journey undertaken over almost a year of research to identify the best **pose estimation** solution applicable to the arm using only a monocular camera. This task is one of the main challenges in modern computer vision.
