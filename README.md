## Introduction
The goal of the project was to implement a look and move vision control architecture on the Arduino arm, namely a position controlled robot in which a vision device (camera) is used to detect an object in the 
robotâ€™s scene, whose position (and orientation) is then used for online path planning in order to drive the robot to the identified object, which in our case was a 3D printed cube (the orange one in the image above).
